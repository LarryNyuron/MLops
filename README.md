# Project management methodology

To effectively conduct our project, we use the following principles and practices:

1. **GitHub Flow**: We follow the GitHub Flow methodology for version and release management. This means that we regularly create branches for new features or fixes, and then merge them back into the main branch after testing and reviewing.

2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: We use GitHub Actions to automate the process of building and testing code. Each commit goes through a series of tests to ensure the quality and stability of the code.

3. **Code Review**: All code changes go through a review process before being merged into the main branch. This helps maintain high code quality and prevents errors.

4. **Documentation**: We pay great attention to project documentation. All features and APIs should be well documented so that new contributors can easily become familiar with the project.

5. **Community Guidelines**: We value our community and strive to create a friendly and inclusive environment for all members. We follow the principles of [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) to maintain a healthy atmosphere in the project.
